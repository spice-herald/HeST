# HeST
Fast python-based yields simulation technique for producing LHe yields

This is an early developmental version of a yields simulation package. Further development will continue. 

## Install from pip

In the terminal, simply use: 

`pip install HeST`

Then in your python scripts you can use: 

`from HeST import HeST`

which will get you all of the functions in HeST

## Install from source (Recommended)

You'll need to clone the code from git:

`git clone git@github.com:spice-herald/HeST.git`

Then from within the newly cloned "HeST" directory, install with:

`pip install .`

This is recommended simply so that the user has access to the source files, see how things are defined, and make custom changes. 

## Simple Example

A jupyter notebook, "ExampleUsage.ipynb" has been included for an example of how to generate events.
